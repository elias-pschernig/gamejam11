GAME DESIGN

Victim (NPC)
Killer (Player)
Bit

Bits spawn randomly on the screen. Victims are controlled by the
computer, walk around semi-randomly and try to eat bits.
When a victim has collected enough bits, it splits in two.
Killer can shoot Victims with a gun and can also eat bits (for points).
When a Victim is killed, it explodes into bits, which can be eaten
by other Victims.

Goal is to control the Victim population and eventually kill all of them
(Extinction).
